I've recently written two romantic comedies, one about fifth graders called ""My Clueless First Friend"" and one about high schoolers, ""More Than a Married Couple, but not Lovers."" We would discuss vocal, attitude, and vernacular shifts when portraying characters just a few years apart.
Talking Trigun Stampede (one hour)- I wrote the dub for and acted in this show! I adore it and have been seeing a lot of people cosplaying the characters recently.
Adaptive Scriptwriting for Anime (one hour)- I write full time for Crunchyroll! People always ask me questions about this online, so maybe a general panel would have some demand.
Making a Character Your Own (one hour)- General acting stuff, but diving into making the fine line between making a character your own and pulling too far away from the original Japanese intent.

Marissa Lenti,Marissa Lenti,9/18/1992,993422704,"Marissa will not fly on Spirit Airlines. They prefer to avoid Delta, United, American, Southwest, and Frontier when possible, but can fly them, in that order, if necessary to fulfill other travel requirements. her preferred airlines are Alaska, Virgin Airlines, and JetBlue (also in that order). Other airlines not named are also acceptable, but less preferred (Marissa has never flown them before if not listed). When flying internationally, an airline local to the destination would also be acceptable, and often preferred (ex. Japan Airlines when flying to Japan is preferred over any American airline company). For direct flights 7 hours or longer, first or business class is required (or an Even More Space seat when flying JetBlue). Her ideal airport to fly out of is the Hollywood Burbank Airport, and she is required to be booked to fly out of there unless it does not service her final destination at all. Any other airport in California is too far away to be used as a starting point except in situations where they are the only option. Direct flights are mandatory unless they are impossible to book to your location from the preferred airport. Any layovers that cannot be worked around should be at least 1.5 hours long but not longer than 4 hours. There should not be more than one layover unless impossible to work around. They should fly into the closest airport to the event space/hotel if possible, though the starting airport being her preferred airport is more important and should be prioritized if it does not connect to the closest airport to the venue. Aisle seats preferred, then window. Middle seats are unacceptable except when booking a last-minute event where no other seats are available, while fulfilling other travel requirements. When flying an airline with open seating (like Southwest), an early seating group is requested if possible.","Allergies: N/A, Dietary Needs: Small snackable items and drinks required to be provided in green room to prevent potential fainting spells during event.

Title: From Fan-Fiction to Fan-Reality with Marissa Lenti (1 hour)
Description: Do you dream of being a part of the anime industry? Are you a fan artist, fanfiction writer, AMV editor, or anyone else who produces fandom content? You may feel like those things could come back to haunt you, but you couldn’t be further from the truth! There are some things you should know, though. Come talk with Marissa Lenti about how producing fan content can help you in the long run, how to transition into professional work, and how fanwork played a part in her journey to the anime industry.

Special Requirements: 1 microphone/speaker set must be provided. A skirted table & chair set-up is requested. Additional panelists can be added, title of panel & description just needs to be changed accordingly.

Title: Let’s Battle! Versus Marissa Lenti (2 hours for small events, 3 hours recommended but not required for big events)
Description: Come and take on Marissa Lenti in a Pokémon battle! Watch others compete and try to win against one of three monotype Gym Leader teams based on ones previously run by Marissa at the PAX Pokémon League. Winners will be gifted a badge while supplies last. Previous champions seeking a rematch can request a team to battle in order to collect all the badges by showing their previously won badge! (A Switch and a copy of Pokémon Sword or Shield are needed to compete. This panel is NOT affiliated in any way with official Pokémon Company battle events—just for fun!)

Special Requirements: 3 microphones must be provided (one for the panelist, one for challengers, and one for an MC), as well as a projector/screen, a TV that works with the projector w/ HDMI ports that a docked Nintendo Switch can be connected to (or HDMI cables for the Switch dock that can connect directly to the projector), a Switch dock, and speakers that can play audio from the TV/Switch for the entire room. One staff member who can set up, troubleshoot, and monitor all the tech throughout the panel is requested, as well as one MC to commentate the battles. Seating for two on stage/at the front of the room and a skirted table set-up are also requested. No additional panelists may be added. If the panel description is edited to be shorter, it is important that the “not affiliated” warning and game requirements (i.e. everything in parentheses at the end) remain.


Group-Only Panels:

Title: Voice Actors After Dark (18+, 2 hours)
Description: There’s just some questions you can’t ask your favorite anime voice actors until it’s after dark. Come and hang out with Marissa Lenti, [name], and [name] as they entertain you totally unfiltered! But be warned-- if you lose a coin flip before you ask your Q, the panelists may ask a Q of you!

Special Requirements: At least 2 other industry guests (preferably other established anime voice actors-- VAs who haven’t appeared in any anime as named characters usually struggle with the questions the audience asks at this panel). A panel room with a closing door-- or that is contained in an 18+ area of the convention-- is also required, as well as security/staffers to enforce a no-recording rule for people within the room/area. This panel does best as a Saturday night event, or less optimally as a Friday night event. It is not recommended to put this event on any other day.

Title: [Show/Game/Job Title] Q&A (1 hour)
This generic Q&A panel can be built using Marissa as well as at least 1 other relevant industry guest. See some sample topics below:

- Borderlands (General/3)
- NANBAKA
- Kemono Friends
- Tribe Nine
- Any other show that she’s appeared in as a named character or worked on as an important staff member-- be sure to edit Marissa’s Convention Bio on your advertising materials to include her credit for any extra shows you want to do panels on so that guests are aware of her role on the show that the panel will be about. (For example, if you chose to do a City Hunter panel, you would want to make sure her bio advertises her role as Saeko and as the ADR Writer, when it normally may not.)
- ADR Writers for Anime
- ADR Directors for Anime
- Pokémon CANNOT be chosen as a Q&A topic (unless the panel includes Lisa Ortiz on it as well)"

Tom Laflin,Thomas Christopher Laflin,2/23/1989,988811047,"DFW is by far my preferred airport; it's about a 12-minute drive from my house. No strong preference on airline, but American tends to have the most flight options out of DFW. I strongly prefer aisle seats. Time of day, ideally 10am-4pm for departure. Having to get up earlier or stay up later isn't the end of the world, but I avoid overnight flights at all costs because I can't sleep in a sitting position. Nonstop flights only unless the distance is so great that a layover and transfer is unavoidable.",No allergies or special needs.,"This is a work in progress; I'll need some time to research and self-reflect in order to develop four distinct panel ideas.

General Q&A (1 hour?) - Simple and straightforward, just introduce myself with a brief biography and then field audience questions about my work, the anime industry, and the broader voice acting industry in general.

Is Voice Acting for Me? (1 hour?) - There are swathes of young anime fans who are starry-eyed at the prospect of becoming voice actors. Plenty of working actors give panels about how to break into the industry with lots of good practical advice. But I think there's a need for one that offers a frank discussion of what the career requires beyond just acting (business skills, networking, self-improvement, dealing with rejection, etc.) and how people who are interested can ease into the work step by step rather than getting ahead of themselves and spending a thousand dollars on equipment before realizing it's not for them. This would likely be a presentation/lecture component followed by Q&A."
Tyson Rinehart,Tyson Rinehart,11/20/1981,,"Southwest or American, aisle seat",None,"Adaptive Writing for Anime Dubs- Dubbing foreign productions is an evolving technique. From timing issues to idioms, sometimes lines have to be tweaked. We'll look at some of the basics that go into turning a translation document into a full, ready for broadcast episode. (1 hour)

Lovecraft Mythos in Gaming-   H.P. Lovecraft's stories have inspired generations of horror and sci-fi novelists and screenwriters. His unique take on man as a small force in a large uncaring universe is perhaps best fleshed out in the world of video games. From nods and easter eggs, to entire games based on Lovecraftian themes, we'll explore his effect on storytelling in the medium. (1 hour)

D&D panel - Can run a quickish adventure with other guests in front of a live audience (with a little audience participation sprinkled in), preferably 18+ (2-3 hours)

Any Group VA panel (1 hour+)

Cards Against Humanity, etc. Late night 18+ panels (1 hour+; no recording whatsoever)"
